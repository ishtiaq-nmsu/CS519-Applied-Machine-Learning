Instruction to run code:

This is Jupyter Notebook file and run the code in jupyter notebook

1. It is required to run all the notebook cell in order
2. There is header for all the code cell as per the Task
3. First need to run the Imports
4. To read the dataset, necessary dataset web link is provided in the prompt. Intenet connection is required.
5. Since file format is different, for two different dataset, two different code is used. 

Two dataset is used:
1. Iris dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/iris/iris.data
2. Wifi_localization dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00422/wifi_localization.txt
	The data set contains wifi signal strength observed from 7 wifi devices on a smartphone collected in indoor space. 
	The data could be used to estimate the location in one of the four rooms.

The program will take input for the classifiers name. If the input classifier name is wrong it will not run. Classifiers names will be in the text prompt when run the program

For task 7 multiclass classifier, no need to give input for classifier name as it is based on SGD binary classifier. Only link for dataset is required. Just run the program, give input of the dataset and it will show the accuracy of the multiclass classifier.
