Instruction to run code:

This is Jupyter Notebook file and run the code in jupyter notebook

1. It is required to run all the notebook cell in order
2. There is header for all the code cell as per the Task
3. First need to run the Imports and then run all the code cell sequentially. 
4. To read the second dataset, necessary dataset web link is provided. Intenet connection is required. Also, the dataset is included in the submission.
5. If any hyper parameter of a classifier needs to be changed, then changed it in the code cell with heading Task 1 where all the classifier instances were declared.
6. To run the code in google colab, uoload the ipynb file and run.

Two dataset is used:

1. Digits dataset: This dataset is available in sklearn library
2. Wifi_localization dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00422/wifi_localization.txt
	The data set contains wifi signal strength observed from 7 wifi devices on a smartphone collected in indoor space. The data could be used to estimate the location of wifi device in one of the four rooms.
