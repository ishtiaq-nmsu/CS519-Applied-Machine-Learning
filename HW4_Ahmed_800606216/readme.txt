Instruction to run code:

This is Jupyter Notebook file and run the code in jupyter notebook.

1. It is required to run all the notebook cell in order
2. There is header for all the code cell as per the Task
3. First need to run the Imports and then run all the code cell sequentially. 
4. To run the code in google colab, upload the ipynb file and run.
5. Internet connection is required to load the datasets. 


There might be a warning like below while running the codes for MNIST dataset:

"UndefinedMetricWarning: Precision is ill-defined and being set to 0.0 in labels with no predicted samples. Use `zero_division` parameter to control this behavior."

This is waring may come as a subset of MNIST datset is used and it is possible that the denominator to calculation precision is zero.
